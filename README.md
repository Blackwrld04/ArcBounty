## What is ArcBounty?

Traditional freelance platforms (Upwork, Fiverr) charge punishing **10%–20% intermediary rake fees**, hold creator earnings for 14-day clearance windows, and subject cross-border contributors to predatory FX conversion rates. Conversely, legacy Web3 bounty boards require contributors to hold volatile gas tokens (ETH/SOL) just to claim rewards, while open submissions expose creators to idea theft and plagiarism prior to contest deadlines.

**ArcBounty resolves these structural failures with five core pillars:**

1. **100% Dollar-Stable Escrow**: All prizes are funded and locked in Canonical Circle USDC (`0x3600000000000000000000000000000000000000`), protecting both sponsors and creators from crypto volatility.
2. **Zero-Gas Creator Claiming**: Contributors never pay gas fees. Payout settlements utilize EIP-3009 `transferWithAuthorization` signatures relayed by the platform facilitator.
3. **Blind Submissions Privacy**: Competitors see only aggregate submission counts; individual deliverable URLs, design files, and contributor identities remain private until contest conclusion, preventing plagiarism.
4. **Single-Submission Constraint & Revisions**: Contributors are strictly prevented from spamming duplicate submissions. They submit once and can revise (`v1` &rarr; `v2`) with transparent audit trails prior to deadlines.
5. **Dual-Engine Database Resilience**: High-throughput embedded SQLite caching ($<1\text{ms}$ response times) synchronized with an enterprise Supabase PostgreSQL connection pool.

## Why ArcBounty exists

Modern Web3 protocols and decentralized ecosystems thrive on open contribution—software development, 3D motion graphics, technical documentation, branding, and community marketing. 

However, existing incentive rails fail creators:

| Role | Provides | Receives |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Creator / Builder** | High-impact creative deliverables (code, design, video, writing) | 100% of agreed USDC prize disbursed in $<400\text{ms}$ with zero gas deduction |
| **Sponsor / Protocol** | Clear task briefs and verifiable on-chain escrow funding | Verified deliverables, rubric evaluation tools, and complete audit ledgers |
| **Platform Facilitator** | EIP-3009 relay execution, blind privacy triage, dual-database sync | Trustless, transparent ecosystem growth on Circle Arc L1 |

### The Failures ArcBounty Overcomes:

1. **The Intermediary Fee Extraction**: Traditional talent platforms siphon up to 20% of creator earnings. On ArcBounty, creators receive 100% of the disbursed reward.
2. **The Idea Theft / Plagiarism Dilemma**: On open GitHub or public Web3 bounty forums, early submissions are often copied or tweaked by rival contributors before the deadline. ArcBounty enforces **Blind Submissions Privacy**, revealing only aggregate counts to non-admins.
3. **The Multi-Token Gas Friction**: Requiring a designer or writer in Nigeria, Brazil, or the Philippines to acquire ETH or SOL on an exchange just to claim a USDC bounty destroys conversion. ArcBounty settles payouts natively with zero creator gas.
4. **Dispute & Sybil Prevention**: Built-in self-participation lockouts prevent sponsors from claiming their own bounties, while structured rubric scoring (1–10) ensures objective deliverable evaluation.

## How ArcBounty works

ArcBounty coordinates sponsors, contributors, and administrators through a streamlined, non-custodial lifecycle.

## Why Circle Arc L1 is load-bearing for ArcBounty

ArcBounty cannot deliver its zero-gas, sub-second user experience on legacy EVM chains. Circle's Arc Layer-1 network (`eip155:5042`) provides foundational architectural capabilities purpose-built for stablecoin-denominated platforms:

| Arc Native Capability | How ArcBounty Leverages It | What Breaks Without It |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Native USDC Gas Accounting** | Gas fees are natively paid and accounted in USDC. | On Ethereum or Base, users must acquire and balance volatile ETH just to pay gas. |
| **Canonical EIP-3009 Support** | Canonical Arc USDC (`0x3600...0000`) natively supports `transferWithAuthorization`. | Legacy tokens require a 2-step `approve()` + `transferFrom()` transaction model. |
| **Sub-Second Malachite BFT Finality** | Sub-second deterministic block inclusion. | 15–30s confirmation delays cause sluggish UI updates and race conditions during submissions. |
| **Predictable Sequencer Gas Floor** | Arc enforces a predictable $\ge 20\text{ Gwei}$ sequencer fee floor. | Wild gas spikes make platform-subsidized creator settlements economically unsustainable. |

---

## Security properties & architectural invariants

### 1. Blind Submissions Privacy
To protect intellectual property, prevent plagiarism, and ensure impartial evaluation:
- Unauthenticated visitors and rival contributors querying `GET /api/bounties/:id` receive only the aggregate `submissionsCount`.
- Deliverable URLs, notes, collaborator lists, and contributor names are stripped from the payload.
- Only the **submitting creator** (via their authenticated session token) can view and revise their own submission.
- Full submission details are accessible exclusively by the **Master Administrator** for scoring.

### 2. Anti-Race-Condition Single Submission Rule
```text
CONSTRAINT unique_submission_per_creator:
  WHERE bounty_id = :bountyId AND (
    creator_id = :userId OR 
    LOWER(wallet_address) = LOWER(:walletAddress) OR 
    LOWER(creator_email) = LOWER(:email)
  )
```
Contributors cannot submit multiple entries to the same challenge. Attempting a duplicate submission returns `HTTP 400 Bad Request`. Contributors must use `PUT /api/bounties/:id/submissions/:submissionId` to revise their existing entry prior to the deadline, preserving version history (`revisionCount`).

### 3. Sponsor Self-Participation Prevention
Sponsors are strictly prohibited from participating in or claiming prizes from bounties they authored:
```javascript
if (
  (bounty.maintainerEmail && submitterEmail === bounty.maintainerEmail) ||
  (bounty.maintainer && submitterWallet === bounty.maintainer)
) {
  return res.status(403).json({ error: 'Bounty creators cannot participate in their own bounties.' });
}
```

### 4. Single Master Administrator Policy
Administrative authority (bounty approval, rubric scoring, and escrow settlement) is strictly gated to `olajideabdulquadri22@gmail.com`:
- Non-admin sessions attempting administrative actions receive an immediate `403 Forbidden`.
- The Admin Portal is fortified behind a secondary master password gate (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`).
- Session tokens expire automatically after 24 hours.

### 5. Dual-Engine Database Consistency
```text
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│     Client Request (Port 5173)  │
└────────────────┬────────────────┘
                 │
                 ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│    Express Facilitator API      │
└────────┬───────────────┬────────┘
         │               │
         ▼ (<1ms)        ▼ (Pooled AWS)
┌─────────────────┐   ┌───────────────────────────┐
│ Embedded SQLite │   │ Supabase PostgreSQL Pool  │
│  (WAL Mode)     │   │   (Max 25 Connections)    │
└─────────────────┘   └───────────────────────────┘
```
- **Local Engine**: Embedded SQLite in Write-Ahead Log (WAL) mode provides sub-millisecond local reads and transactional safety.
- **Production Engine**: Supabase PostgreSQL with AWS connection pooling handles horizontal scaling and multi-region resilience.

## The Smart Contract & Settlement Specification

### Escrow Contract Interface (`ArcBountyEscrow.sol`)

```solidity
interface IArcBountyEscrow {
    event BountyCreated(bytes32 indexed bountyId, address indexed sponsor, uint256 amount);
    event BountyDisbursed(bytes32 indexed bountyId, address indexed recipient, uint256 amount, bytes32 txHash);
    event BountyRefunded(bytes32 indexed bountyId, address indexed sponsor, uint256 amount);

    function createBounty(bytes32 bountyId, uint256 amount, uint256 deadlineDays) external;
    function disburseReward(bytes32 bountyId, address payable recipient, uint256 amount) external;
    function disburseMultiWinner(bytes32 bountyId, address[] calldata recipients, uint256[] calldata amounts) external;
    function refundBounty(bytes32 bountyId) external;
}
```

## Verify it yourself

You can independently verify the entire ArcBounty system locally using the automated test suites and agent verification runner:

### 1. Run Backend Unit & Integration Tests (35 Tests)
```bash
cd server
npm test
```
*Executes all 35 tests covering escrow disbursements, single-submission constraints, deadline expiration, admin passwords, rubric scoring, and SQLite auth.*

### 2. Run Autonomous End-to-End Audit Runner
```bash
cd server
node test/agent_e2e_verification.js
```
*Simulates a complete real-world flow: User Registration &rarr; Sponsor Bounty Creation &rarr; Admin Review &rarr; Contributor Blind Submission &rarr; Revision &rarr; Rubric Scoring &rarr; Arc L1 USDC Disbursement &rarr; CSV Ledger Export.*

### 3. Verify Client Production Build & Linting
```bash
cd client
npm run lint
npm run build
```
*Runs `oxlint` across all 29 client files and builds the production bundle with Vite in $<450\text{ms}$.*

## Engineering decisions

1. **Why Blind Submissions instead of Open PRs?**  
   In competitive contests, open submissions lead to "last-minute copycat" behavior where participants duplicate earlier submissions with minor tweaks. Blind submissions ensure every participant is rewarded strictly on the originality and merit of their work.
2. **Why SQLite + Supabase Dual-Engine?**  
   Local SQLite WAL mode guarantees sub-millisecond response times for local testing, offline development, and lightning-fast reads. Connecting Supabase PostgreSQL through connection pooling ensures that production traffic spikes and multi-region read replicas scale horizontally without deadlocks.
3. **Why EIP-3009 instead of standard ERC-20 `approve()`?**  
   Standard `approve` + `transferFrom` requires two separate transactions and forces creators to spend gas. EIP-3009 enables off-chain authorization signatures, allowing the platform to settle payouts gaslessly for contributors.
4. **Why Neo-Brutalist UI?**  
   Clean neo-brutalism provides unmistakable tactile feedback, high visual contrast, and immediate clarity. Buttons, cards, and modal windows have distinct interactive boundaries that function identically on 4K desktop displays and small mobile screens.
